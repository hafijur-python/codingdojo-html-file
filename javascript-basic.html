                <h1>JavaScript Basics</h1>

                <p  class="id1">JavaScript is faster. JavaScript is a client-side language and thus 
                    it does not need the assistance of the web server to execute. On the other hand,
                     ASP is a server-side language and hence is always slower than JavaScript.  
                     Javascript now is also a server side language (nodejs).</p>

                     <ul class="second">
                        
                            <li><p><span class="span1">Variable Declaration</span>  Undeclared variables are those that do not exist 
                                in a program and are not declared. If the program tries to read 
                                the value of an undeclared variable, then a runtime error is encountered
                                Undefined variables are those 
                                that are declared in the program but have not been given any value. 
                                If the program tries to read the value of an undefined variable, 
                                an undefined value is returned.</p></li>
                            <li><p> <span class="span1">Assaignments</span>  Variable typing is used to assign a number to a 
                                variable and the same variable can be assigned to a string. Yes JavaScript does 
                                support automatic type conversion, it is the common way of type conversion used by JavaScript developers</p> 
                                </li>
                            <li> <p> <span class="span1">Data Type</span>  DOM stands for Document Object Model and is responsible for 
                                how various objects in a document interact with each other. DOM is 
                                required for <p> <span class="span2">These objects can be operated to include actions like add or delete</span>developing web pages, which includes objects like paragraph, 
                                links, etc.
                                DOM is also required to add extra capabilities to a web page. On top of that, 
                                the use of API gives an advantage over other existing models.</p></li>
                            <li><span class="span1"> Conditionals </span>T the array.  Also the pop() 
                                method take the last element off <p> <span class="span2">he pop() method is similar as the shift() method but the difference is 
                                        that the Shift method works at the start of</span>of the given array and returns it. The array on which is 
                                called is then altered.</li>
                            <li><span class="span1">Loops</span>Loops Logic errors: It is caused by the use of syntactically correct code, 
                                which does not fulfill the required task. For example, an infinite loop.</li>
                            <li><span class="span1">Functions </span> The function .call() and .apply() are very similar in their
                                 usage except a little difference. .call() is used when the number of the 
                                 functionâ€™s arguments are known to the programmer,  as 
                                 arguments in the call statement. <p> <span class="span2">as they have to be mentioned</span>On the other hand, .apply() is used when the number is not 
                                 known. The function .apply() expects the argument to be an array.</li>
                            <li><span class="span1">Projects </span>  By default, the parsing of the HTML code, during page loading, is paused
                                 until the script has not stopped executing. It means, 
                                 if the server is slow or the script is particularly heavy, then the
                                  webpage is displayed with a delay. While using Deferred, scripts delays execution 
                                  of the script till the time HTML parser is running. This reduces the loading time of web 
                                  pages and they get displayed faster.</li>
                            <li><span class="span1">Assaignments </span>  Namespacing is used for grouping the desired functions, variables etc. 
                                under a unique name. It is a name that has been attached to the desired functions,
                                 objects and properties. This improves modularity in the coding and enables code reuse.</li>
                            <li><span class="span1">AQuiz </span> innerHTML content is refreshed every time and thus is slower. 
                                There is no scope for validation in innerHTML and, 
                                therefore, it is easier to insert rouge code in the document and, 
                                thus, make the web page unstable.</li>
